# Projects Used
- **GuestSneezeOS** is an OS aimed to bring SteamOS 3 on Older Hardware Using Debian GNU/Linux but now is using the Archiso Project to make archlinux based operating system .The full source code of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/GuestSneezeOS-Official/GuestSneezeOS)
- **HoloISO** is an Arch Linux-Based OS also known as "Hackintosh of SteamOS 3" For Desktop PC's. The project attempts to bring the Steam Deck's SteamOS Holo redistribution into a generic, installable format, and provide a close-to-official SteamOS experience. Main point of this project focuses in re-implementing proprietary (as in runs-only-on-deck) components that Steam client, OS itself, gamescope and user-created applications for Deck rely on and making me learn Linux in a fun and unique way. The source code can be found [here](https://github.com/holoiso/releases)
- **SteamOS 3 Jupiter** is a Linux distribution developed by Valve. It incorporates Valve's popular namesake Steam video game storefront and is the primary operating system for the Steam Deck, Valve's portable gaming device,SteamOS is open source with some closed source components.With the release of Version 3.0, older versions of SteamOS are no longer supported and are not maintained. Valve has not released a version of SteamOS 3.0 intended for devices other than the Steam Deck, though community resources exist for installing it onto commercial hardware.
